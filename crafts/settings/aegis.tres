With the right support, it can unleash devastating large-scale damage, turning the tide of battle in an instant. However, its lightweight frame comes at a costâ€”limited armor and defensive capabilities make it vulnerable in prolonged engagements, requiring strategic maneuvering to stay ahead of threats."
