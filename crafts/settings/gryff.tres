craft_lore = "A balanced craft with moderate defensive and offensive capabilities, the Gryff thrives on agility. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to outmaneuver opponents, weaving circles around them with ease. Nearly airborne in its movement, it glides effortlessly across rough terrain, maintaining speed and control where others struggle. While not the most heavily armored, its evasive nature makes it a difficult target to pin down."
